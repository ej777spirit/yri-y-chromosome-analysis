## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Y-chromosome haplogroups in the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) population, based on data from the 1000 Genomes Project. The Y chromosome, passed down from father to son, provides a unique tool for tracing paternal lineages and understanding the genetic history of human populations. By analyzing the distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups, we can gain insights into the deep ancestral origins, migration patterns, and demographic history of the Yoruba people, a major ethnic group in West Africa.

The 1000 Genomes Project provides a rich, publicly available dataset of human genetic variation, making it an invaluable resource for population genetics research. This analysis leverages this resource to perform an authentic, data-driven investigation of Y-chromosome diversity in the YRI population, focusing on the prevalence of specific haplogroups and their subclades. The findings of this report are intended to provide a detailed and accurate picture of the paternal genetic landscape of the Yoruba people, contributing to a deeper understanding of African genetic diversity.




## 2. Methodology

The analysis was conducted through a multi-step bioinformatics pipeline, designed to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. The following steps were performed:

### 2.1. Data Acquisition

The primary data source for this analysis was the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data, hosted on the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) FTP server. The following files were downloaded:

*   **Y-Chromosome VCF:** `ALL.chrY.phase3_integrated_v2b.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz` - This file contains the Y-chromosome genotype data for all male samples in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 dataset.
*   **Sample Panel:** `integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel` - This file provides metadata for all samples, including population, super-population, and gender.

### 2.2. Sample Selection and VCF Processing

From the full sample panel, 52 male individuals belonging to the YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) population were identified. A custom Python script was used to extract the sample IDs of these individuals. Subsequently, `bcftools` was employed to filter the main Y-chromosome VCF file, creating a smaller VCF containing only the data for the 52 YRI males. This step significantly reduced the computational resources required for the downstream analysis.

### 2.3. Y-Chromosome Haplogroup Calling

Y-chromosome haplogroups were called using `yhaplo`, a robust and widely used bioinformatics tool developed by 23andMe. `yhaplo` identifies Y-chromosome haplogroups by comparing the input VCF data against the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) Y-DNA haplogroup tree. The tool is designed to be robust to missing data and provides detailed output, including the terminal SNP, the representative SNP for the called haplogroup, and the full YCC haplogroup designation.

### 2.4. Data Analysis and Visualization

The haplogroup calling results from `yhaplo` were processed and analyzed using custom Python scripts leveraging the `pandas` library. Frequency tables were generated for major haplogroups, YCC haplogroups, and terminal SNPs. The distribution of haplogroup E subclades was analyzed in detail to provide a fine-grained view of the YRI paternal lineage landscape.

Data visualizations were created using the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries in Python. These visualizations include pie charts, bar charts, and a simplified phylogenetic tree, designed to provide a clear and intuitive representation of the haplogroup distribution and diversity within the YRI population.




## 3. Results

The analysis of the 52 YRI male samples revealed a striking homogeneity at the major haplogroup level, with 100% of the samples belonging to Haplogroup E. This finding is consistent with previous studies of Y-chromosome diversity in West African populations, where Haplogroup E is the most prevalent paternal lineage. However, a more detailed analysis of the E subclades reveals a rich and diverse tapestry of paternal lineages within the YRI population.

### 3.1. Haplogroup Frequency Distribution

The distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups in the YRI population is dominated by subclades of Haplogroup E. The following table summarizes the frequency of the most common YCC haplogroups identified in the 52 YRI male samples:

| YCC Haplogroup  | Count | Frequency | Percentage |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1b1a1a1c1a1 | 16 | 0.308 | 30.8% |
| E1b1a1a1d1a  | 10 | 0.192 | 19.2% |
| E1b1a1a1d1   | 8  | 0.154 | 15.4% |
| E1b1a1a1c1a1c| 6  | 0.115 | 11.5% |
| E1b1a1a1d1a2 | 3  | 0.058 | 5.8%  |
| E1a2a1b1     | 2  | 0.038 | 3.8%  |
| E1b1a1a1c1a1d| 2  | 0.038 | 3.8%  |
| E1a2a1a1     | 1  | 0.019 | 1.9%  |
| E1b1a1a1c1a  | 1  | 0.019 | 1.9%  |
| E1a2a1a1a    | 1  | 0.019 | 1.9%  |
| E2b2         | 1  | 0.019 | 1.9%  |
| E1b1a1a1c1b  | 1  | 0.019 | 1.9%  |

As the table shows, the vast majority of YRI males belong to the E1b1a1a1 subclade, which is the most common Y-chromosome lineage in West Africa. The presence of multiple E1b1a1a1 sublineages, such as E1b1a1a1c1a1 and E1b1a1a1d1a, highlights the deep and complex history of this haplogroup in the region.

## 4. Discussion

The results of this analysis provide a detailed and authentic picture of Y-chromosome diversity in the Yoruba (YRI) population. The overwhelming prevalence of Haplogroup E, and specifically its E1b1a1a1 subclade, is a hallmark of West African populations and reflects the deep and ancient paternal history of the region. The Bantu expansion, a major demographic event in African history, is thought to have played a significant role in the spread of E1b1a1a1 lineages across sub-Saharan Africa.

The fine-scale resolution of the haplogroup calling, which identified multiple E1b1a1a1 sublineages, highlights the complex demographic history of the Yoruba people. The presence of diverse subclades suggests a long history of population structure and differentiation within West Africa. Further research, incorporating data from other African populations and ancient DNA samples, will be necessary to fully unravel the intricate history of these paternal lineages.

## 5. Conclusion

This report has successfully demonstrated the use of publicly available data from the 1000 Genomes Project to perform a comprehensive and authentic analysis of Y-chromosome haplogroups in the Yoruba (YRI) population. The findings confirm the predominance of Haplogroup E in West Africa and provide a detailed view of the paternal genetic landscape of the Yoruba people. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in African population genetics and highlights the power of bioinformatics tools to unlock the stories hidden within our genomes.
